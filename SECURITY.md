## Reporting a Vulnerability

## Report bugs using Github's [Issues](https://github.com/Alpha-Incorporated/Convex-Hull-Algorithms/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [Opening a new issue](https://github.com/Alpha-Incorporated/Convex-Hull-Algorithms/issues/new); it's that Easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding..
